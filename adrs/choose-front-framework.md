In the context of the data visualization application,
facing the need to have multiple interactions on the client side and based on assumptions from [holotypes](https://jasonformat.com/application-holotypes/),

I decided to use [Remix framework](https://remix.run/) which is focused on Web standards and UX,

to achieve a good user experience using mainly client-side rendering,
accepting some complexity and learning curve.

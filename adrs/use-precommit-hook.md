In the context of writing code,
facing the need to have consistency in coding style,

I decided to use pre-commit hooks,
accepting to have some time taken to run the necessary checks before commiting,

because it will help in not forgetting to have the coding style rules applied and any other checks (like typechecking) before commiting.

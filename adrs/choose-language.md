In the context of implementing features,
facing the need to be more productive and for maintainability and readability of code,

I decided to use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) which is a superset of JavaScript,
accepting some constraints brought by the language with a bit of configuration and some extra time for compiling,

because Typescript will catch some bugs thanks to its compile-time type checker and gives a better tooling for structuring the code.

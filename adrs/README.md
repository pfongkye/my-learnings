# Architecture Decision Records

[Architecture Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/) capture the decisions and tradeoffs made during the development of the application. 
[Light ADRs](https://medium.com/olzzio/y-statements-10eb07b5a177) are written in a format that is relatively easy to read and understand. They contain the essential information driving the decisions taken.
The collection of ADRs will constitute the decision log of the application.
